* TODO
** DONE Implement auth
** DONE Implement syncing up all data from the server to the client
** DONE Implement Storage to store all lists and the auth token
** TODO Implement the first step of the ui generating auth link and saving token after that
   it should also check the auth token each time you start rtm

* IDEAS
  - [ ] Always set the list name as the first tag for all tasks
  - [ ] Use interactive mode for moving elements
  - [ ] Change numbers of elements when assigning priorities to them,
    as it changes the order and numbers should reflect the order
  - [ ] Remove numbers to display elements in smart lists
  - [ ] Check if it's possible to set the position property for lists
    and tasks
