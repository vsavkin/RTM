* TODO
** DONE Implement auth
** TODO Implement syncing up all data from the server to the client
- [ ] Implement RTM::Repository#fetch_user_data
  Gateway.get_all_lists.map{|s| get_all_tasks(id)}

* IDEAS
  - [ ] Always set the list name as the first tag for all tasks
  - [ ] Use interactive mode for moving elements
  - [ ] Change numbers of elements when assigning priorities to them,
    as it changes the order and numbers should reflect the order
  - [ ] Remove numbers to display elements in smart lists
